### Question 01
A food delivery service wants to manage food item orders. Write a Java program to handle food ordering and update stock accordingly.

**a)** Write a class called `FoodItem` to represent the details of a food item with the following private attributes:  
- `itemId`  
- `itemName`  
- `price`  
- `quantityAvailable`

**b)** Implement a constructor that accepts `itemId`, `itemName`, `price`, and `quantityAvailable` as parameters.

**c)** Implement a method called `placeOrder()` which accepts the number of units a customer wants to order. It should:  
- If `quantityAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:  
  `"Sorry, not enough stock. Please order fewer units or choose another item."`  
- Otherwise:  
  - Deduct the requested quantity from `quantityAvailable`.  
  - Display: `"Order placed successfully! Total price: Rs.<calculated_amount>"`

**d)** Implement a method called `displayItemDetails()` to display the complete details of the item, including how many units are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `FoodOrderApp` to perform the following tasks:  
I. Input details of **two food items** from the user and create two `FoodItem` objects.  
II. Ask how many units a customer wants to order from each item, and process the order using the `placeOrder()` method.  
III. After all order operations, display the details of both items using the `displayItemDetails()` method.
