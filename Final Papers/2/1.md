### Question 01 

A video game store wants to manage the rental of video games to customers. Write a Java program to handle video game rentals and update stock availability accordingly.

**a)** Write a class called `VideoGame` to represent the details of the video games in the store with the following private attributes:  
- `gameId`  
- `title`  
- `platform` (e.g., PC, PS5, Xbox)  
- `copiesInStock`

**b)** Implement a constructor that accepts `gameId`, `title`, `platform`, and `copiesInStock` as parameters.

**c)** Implement a method called `rentGame()`, which accepts the number of copies a customer wants to rent and displays appropriate messages. It should:  
- If `copiesInStock` is less than the requested number, display:  
  `"Insufficient stock. Please try a smaller quantity or check back later."`  
- Otherwise:  
  - Deduct the requested quantity from `copiesInStock`.  
  - Display: `"Game rented successfully!"`

**d)** Implement a method called `displayGameInfo()` to display the complete details of the game, including how many copies are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `GameRentalApp` to perform the following tasks:  
I. Input details of **two video games** from the user and create two `VideoGame` objects.  
II. Ask how many copies a customer wants to rent for each game, and process the rental using the `rentGame()` method.  
III. After all rental operations, display the details of all the games using the `displayGameInfo()` method.
