### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a student ID and grade score, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

‚Ä¢ **InvalidStudentID** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Student ID must start with 'S' and max length is 6." if the user input for the student ID does not follow the format.

‚Ä¢ **InvalidGradeRange** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Grade must be between 0 and 100" if the user input for the grade is less than 0 or greater than 100.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **GradeValidationApp** to get the user inputs for the student ID and grade score and then validate those for the above two conditions. 

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

If the input has one or more custom exceptions, you should have proper try-catch statements to handle the exceptions.
