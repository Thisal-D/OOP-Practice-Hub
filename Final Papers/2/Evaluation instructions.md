| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| 01          | Constructors, Getters, Setters, Constructor Overloading, Method Overloading | 20    |
| 02          | Noun-Verb Analysis and CRC Cards                                            | 15    |
| 03          | Exception Handling                                                          | 15    |

## Evaluation Criteria

### Coding-Based Questions (Q1, Q3, Q4, Q5B)

* **2 marks** reserved for matching the expected output exactly.
* Remaining marks will be allocated based on:

  * **Requirement Coverage:** Check if the student’s solution addresses all requirements specified in the corresponding GitHub question.
  * **Logic & Correctness:** Is the solution logically correct and effective?
  * **Use of Relevant OOP Concepts:** Appropriateness and correctness of applied concepts such as:

    * Constructors and Constructor Overloading
    * Getters and Setters
    * Method Overloading
    * Exception Handling
    * Class Relationships (Composition, Aggregation, Inheritance)
    * Interfaces and Static Members
    * Collections (e.g., ArrayList)

> **Note:** The implementation details do not have to be identical to the provided answer, but should meet the requirements.

---

### Theory-Based Questions (Q2, Q5A)

* There is **no single “correct” answer**.
* Marks awarded based on:

  * Accurate use and explanation of OOP concepts
  * Logical clarity and coherence
  * Completeness and organization of the response

    * For Q2: Correct noun-verb analysis, filtering, and CRC card structure
    * For Q5A: Clear explanations and application of SOLID principles

## Submission & Evaluation Process

* You will receive one answer per question from each friend.
* If a question is unanswered, the input will be **“No answer”**.
* After receiving **all six answers** for a friend, you will receive the command **“evaluate start”**.
* Only begin evaluation when you see **“evaluate start”**.
