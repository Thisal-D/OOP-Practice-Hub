### Question 01
A cinema wants to manage movie ticket bookings. Write a Java program to handle the booking process and update seat availability accordingly.

**a)** Write a class called `MovieShow` to represent the details of a movie show with the following private attributes:  
- `showId`  
- `movieTitle`  
- `showTime`  
- `seatsAvailable`

**b)** Implement a constructor that accepts `showId`, `movieTitle`, `showTime`, and `seatsAvailable` as parameters.

**c)** Implement a method called `bookTickets()`, which accepts the number of seats a customer wants to book and displays appropriate messages. It should:  
- If `seatsAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:  
  `"Not enough seats available. Please select fewer seats or another show."`  
- Otherwise:  
  - Deduct the requested number of seats from `seatsAvailable`.  
  - Display: `"Booking successful!"`

**d)** Implement a method called `displayShowDetails()` to display the complete details of the show, including how many seats are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `CinemaApp` to perform the following tasks:  
I. Input details of **two movie shows** from the user and create two `MovieShow` objects.  
II. Ask how many seats a customer wants to book for each show, and process the booking using the `bookTickets()` method.  
III. After all booking operations, display the details of both shows using the `displayShowDetails()` method.
