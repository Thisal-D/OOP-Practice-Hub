### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an account number and withdrawal amount, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**


‚Ä¢ **InvalidAccountNumber** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Account number must be exactly 12 digits long" if the user input for the account number does not contain exactly 12 numeric digits.

‚Ä¢ **InsufficientBalance** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Withdrawal amount cannot exceed current balance" if the user input for the withdrawal amount is greater than the available account balance (assume current balance is $1000).

```java
private static final double CURRENT_BALANCE = 1000.0;
```

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **BankTransactionApp** to get the user inputs for the account number and withdrawal amount and then validate those for the above two conditions. 

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

If the input has one or more custom exceptions, you should have proper try-catch statements to handle the exceptions.
