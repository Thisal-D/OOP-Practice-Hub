### Question 04

Develop a **Teacher-Subject Assignment System** implementing a **bidirectional association** where:
- The `Teacher` class maintains references to the subjects they teach
- The `Subject` class maintains references to the teacher assigned

---

#### Subject Class Specifications
The `Subject` class represents a subject taught at a school with the following details:

**Attributes:**
- `subjectCode` (String) - Subject identifier
- `subjectName` (String) - Name of the subject
- `teacher` (Teacher) - Reference to the assigned teacher

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize subject attributes upon object creation
- `setTeacher(Teacher teacher)` - Assign a teacher to this subject and update teacher's subject list accordingly
- `displaySubjectDetails()` - Print subject code, name, and teacher's name

---

#### Teacher Class Specifications
The `Teacher` class models a teacher who can teach up to **four subjects**.

**Attributes:**
- `teacherID` (String) - Teacher identifier
- `teacherName` (String) - Teacher's full name
- `subjects[]` (Subject array) - Fixed-size array to store subjects taught (size = 4)
- `subjectCount` (int) - Track number of currently assigned subjects

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize teacher details
- `addSubject(Subject subject)` - Add subject to array (only if `subjectCount < 4`) and set this teacher as the subject's teacher; if full, show an error message
- `displayTeacherDetails()` - Print teacher information and all assigned subject details

---

### Implement the Main Class

- Create at least 4 Subject objects with different details
- Create 1 Teacher object using parameterized constructor
- Use `addSubject()` to assign all 4 subjects to the teacher
- Call `displayTeacherDetails()` to show final output
- Also, demonstrate navigation from a subject to its teacher by calling `displaySubjectDetails()` for at least one subject

---

## Main Method Requirements

1. **Create Subject Objects**
   - Instantiate four `Subject` objects with unique codes and names

2. **Create Teacher Object**
   - Use parameterized constructor to initialize teacher details

3. **Assign Subjects to Teacher**
   - Use `addSubject()` method to assign all four subjects to the teacher

4. **Display Results**
   - Call `displayTeacherDetails()` to print complete teacher information and assigned subjects
   - Call `displaySubjectDetails()` on at least one subject to show its assigned teacher

---

## Expected Output Format

The system should display:
- Teacher ID and Name
- Number of assigned subjects
- Details of each assigned subject (using `displaySubjectDetails()` method)
- For the subject example, display subject code, name, and teacher's name
