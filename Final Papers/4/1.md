#### Question 01

A library wants to manage book lending operations. Write a Java program to handle the book borrowing process and track book availability.

#### Part (a)
Write a class called `Book` to represent the details of a book with the following private attributes:
- `bookId`
- `bookTitle`
- `author`
- `copiesAvailable`

#### Part (b)
Implement a constructor that accepts `bookId`, `bookTitle`, `author`, and `copiesAvailable` as parameters.

#### Part (c)
Implement a method called `borrowBook()`, which accepts the number of copies a member wants to borrow and displays appropriate messages. It should:
- If `copiesAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:
  ```
  "Insufficient copies available. Please request fewer copies or try another book."
  ```
- Otherwise:
  - Deduct the requested number of copies from `copiesAvailable`.
  - Display: `"Book borrowed successfully!"`

#### Part (d)
Implement a method called `returnBook()` that accepts the number of copies being returned and adds them back to `copiesAvailable`. Display: `"Book returned successfully!"`

#### Part (e)
Implement a method called `displayBookDetails()` to display the complete details of the book, including how many copies are still available.

#### Part (f)
Write another Java class called `LibraryApp` to perform the following tasks:

**I.** Input details of **three books** from the user and create three `Book` objects.

**II.** For each book, ask how many copies a member wants to borrow, and process the borrowing using the `borrowBook()` method.

**III.** For the first book only, ask how many copies are being returned and process using the `returnBook()` method.

**IV.** After all operations, display the details of all three books using the `displayBookDetails()` method.
