### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a product code and product price, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

‚Ä¢ **InvalidProductCode** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Product code must starts with 'P' and max length is 6 and ends with 'E'.(p, e : not case sensitive) If user input invalid product code.

‚Ä¢ **InvalidPriceRange** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Product price must be greater than $0.49" if the user input for the product price is less than or equal to $0.5.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **ProductRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the product code and product price and then validate those for the above two conditions. 

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

If the input has one or more custom exceptions, you should have proper try-catch statements to handle the exceptions.
