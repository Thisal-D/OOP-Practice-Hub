### Question 04

Develop a **Company-Employee Management System** implementing a **bidirectional association** where:
- The `Company` class maintains references to employees working in the company
- The `Employee` class maintains a reference to the company they work for

---

#### Employee Class Specifications
The `Employee` class represents an employee with the following details:

**Attributes:**
- `employeeID` (String) - Employee identifier
- `employeeName` (String) - Employee's full name
- `company` (Company) - Reference to the company the employee works for

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize employee details (without company initially)
- `setCompany(Company company)` - Assign the employee to a company and update the company's employee list accordingly
- `displayEmployeeDetails()` - Print employee ID, name, and company name (if assigned)

---

#### Company Class Specifications
The `Company` class models a company that can have up to **five employees**.

**Attributes:**
- `companyID` (String) - Company identifier
- `companyName` (String) - Name of the company
- `employees[]` (Employee array) - Fixed-size array to store employees (size = 5)
- `employeeCount` (int) - Track number of currently employed employees

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize company details
- `addEmployee(Employee employee)` - Add employee to the array (only if `employeeCount < 5`) and set this company as the employee's company; if full, show an error message
- `displayCompanyDetails()` - Print company information and all employee details

---

### Implement the Main Class

- Create at least 4 Employee objects with different details
- Create 1 Company object using parameterized constructor
- Use `addEmployee()` to add all 4 employees to the company
- Call `displayCompanyDetails()` to show final output
- Also, demonstrate navigation from an employee to its company by calling `displayEmployeeDetails()` for at least one employee

---

## Main Method Requirements

1. **Create Employee Objects**
   - Instantiate four `Employee` objects with unique IDs and names

2. **Create Company Object**
   - Use parameterized constructor to initialize company details

3. **Add Employees to Company**
   - Use `addEmployee()` method to add all four employees to the company

4. **Display Results**
   - Call `displayCompanyDetails()` to print complete company information and employee details
   - Call `displayEmployeeDetails()` on at least one employee to show their company
