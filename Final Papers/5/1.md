### Question 01

A restaurant wants to manage table reservations. Write a Java program to handle the reservation process and update table availability accordingly.

**a)** Write a class called `TableReservation` to represent the details of a table reservation with the following private attributes:

* `tableId`
* `tableSize`
* `reservedSeats`
* `isReserved` (boolean)

**b)** Implement **constructor overloading**:

* One constructor should accept `tableId` and `tableSize`, initializing `reservedSeats` to 0 and `isReserved` to false.
* Another constructor should accept all four attributes.

**c)** Implement **method overloading** for `reserveTable()`:

* One version should accept the number of seats a customer wants to reserve. It should:

  * If `isReserved` is true, display:
    `"This table is already reserved. Please select another table."`
  * If the requested number of seats exceeds `tableSize`, display:
    `"Not enough seats available for this table. Please select a smaller number of seats."`
  * Otherwise:

    * Set `isReserved` to true.
    * Update `reservedSeats` with the requested number of seats.
    * Display: `"Reservation successful!"`
* Another overloaded version should take no parameters and reserve **2 seats by default** if the table is available.

**d)** Implement a method called `displayTableDetails()` to display the complete details of the table, including how many seats are reserved and how many are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `RestaurantApp` to perform the following tasks:

I. Input details of **three tables** from the user and create three `TableReservation` objects.

II. Ask how many seats a customer wants to reserve for each table, and process the reservation using the appropriate overloaded version of `reserveTable()`.

III. After all reservation operations, display the details of all tables using the `displayTableDetails()` method.

> 🔁 *Make sure to apply both constructor overloading and method overloading in your implementation.*

  Enter Table ID for table 3: 103
  Enter Table Size (capacity) for table 3: 2

  Enter number of seats to reserve for Table ID 1: 5
  Not enough seats available for this table. Please select a smaller number of seats.

  Enter number of seats to reserve for Table ID 2: 4
