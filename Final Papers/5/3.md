### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an employee ID and age, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

‚Ä¢ **InvalidEmployeeID** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Employee ID must end with 'EMP' and be at least 6 characters long" if the user input for the employee ID does not end with 'EMP' or has fewer than 6 characters total.

‚Ä¢ **InvalidAgeRange** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Employee age must be between 18 and 65" if the user input for the age is less than 18 or greater than 65.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **EmployeeRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the employee ID and age and then validate those for the above two conditions. 

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

If the input has one or more custom exceptions, you should have proper try-catch statements to handle the exceptions.

Absolutely! Here's your updated **Method Usage Policy** in the concise style you're using:
