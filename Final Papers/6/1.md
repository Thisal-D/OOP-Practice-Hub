### Question 01

A gym wants to manage membership registrations and class bookings. Write a Java program to handle the registration process and update class availability accordingly.

**a)** Write a class called `GymClass` to represent the details of a gym class with the following private attributes:

* `classId`
* `className`
* `classTime`
* `spotsAvailable`

**b)** Implement **constructor overloading** in `GymClass`:

* One constructor should accept all four parameters: `classId`, `className`, `classTime`, and `spotsAvailable`.
* Another constructor should accept only `classId` and `className`, and assign default values:
  `classTime = "To be announced"` and `spotsAvailable = 0`.

**c)** Implement **method overloading** for a method called `bookClass()`:

* One version should accept the number of spots a customer wants to book and display appropriate messages:

  * If `spotsAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:
    `"Not enough spots available. Please select fewer spots or another class."`
  * Otherwise:

    * Deduct the requested number of spots from `spotsAvailable`.
    * Display: `"Booking successful!"`
* Another version should take **no parameters** and book **1 spot by default**.

**d)** Implement a method called `displayClassDetails()` to display the complete details of the class, including how many spots are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `GymApp` to perform the following tasks:
I. Input details of **two gym classes** from the user ‚Äî one using the full constructor and one using the overloaded constructor.
II. Ask how many spots a customer wants to book for each class, and process the booking using both versions of the `bookClass()` method.
III. After all booking operations, display the details of both classes using the `displayClassDetails()` method.
