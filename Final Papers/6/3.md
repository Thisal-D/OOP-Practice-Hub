### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a book ISBN and publication year, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

‚Ä¢ **InvalidISBNFormat** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "ISBN must be exactly 13 digits long and start with '978' or '979'" if the user input for the ISBN does not contain exactly 13 digits or does not start with '978' or '979'.

‚Ä¢ **InvalidPublicationYear** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "Publication year must be between 1900 and current year" if the user input for the publication year is less than 1900 or greater than 2025.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **BookRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the book ISBN and publication year and then validate those for the above two conditions.
