### Question 01

A bookstore wants to manage its book inventory and sales. Write a Java program to handle the process of adding books and processing sales.

**a)** Write a class called `Book` to represent the details of a book with the following private attributes:

* `bookId`
* `title`
* `author`
* `price`
* `quantityAvailable`

**b)** Implement **constructor overloading** in `Book`:
* One constructor should accept all five parameters: `bookId`, `title`, `author`, `price`, and `quantityAvailable`.
* Another constructor should accept only `bookId`, `title`, and `author`, assigning default values: `price = 0.0` and `quantityAvailable = 0`.

**c)** Implement **method overloading** for a method called `sellBook()`:
* One version should accept the number of copies a customer wants to buy and display appropriate messages:
  * If `quantityAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:
    `"Not enough copies available. Please select fewer copies or another book."`
  * Otherwise:
    * Deduct the requested number of copies from `quantityAvailable`.
    * Display: `"Sale successful!"`
* Another version should take **no parameters** and sell **1 copy by default**.

**d)** Implement a method called `displayBookDetails()` to display the complete details of the book, including how many copies are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `BookstoreApp` to perform the following tasks:
I. Input details of **two books** from the user ‚Äî one using the full constructor and one using the overloaded constructor.
II. Ask how many copies a customer wants to buy for each book, and process the sale using both versions of the `sellBook()` method.
III. After all sale operations, display the details of both books using the `displayBookDetails()` method.
