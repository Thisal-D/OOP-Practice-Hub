### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a product code and quantity in stock, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

‚Ä¢ **InvalidProductCode** ‚Äì is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Product code must be exactly 8 characters and start with 'PRD'"` if the user input for the product code does not conform to these requirements.

‚Ä¢ **InvalidStockQuantity** ‚Äì is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Quantity in stock must be a positive integer (greater than 0)"` if the user input for the quantity is zero or negative.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **ProductRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the product code and quantity in stock and then validate those for the above two conditions.
