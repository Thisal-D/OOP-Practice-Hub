### Question 04

A software company wants to manage its employees and the projects they are assigned to. Write a Java program using **inheritance**, **dependency**, and **method overriding** as follows:

**a)** Create a base class called `Employee` with the following private attributes:
* `employeeId`
* `name`
* `position`

Include a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method called `displayDetails()` to display the employee's information.

**b)** Create a subclass called `Developer` that inherits from `Employee` and adds:
* `programmingLanguage` (private attribute)

Override the `displayDetails()` method so that it displays both the employee's details and their programming language.

**c)** Create a class called `Project` with the following private attributes:
* `projectId`
* `projectName`
* `developer` (of type `Developer`)

Add a constructor to initialize all attributes. The `Project` class should have a method called `displayProjectInfo()` which should display the project details and, using the developer object, display the developer's details as well.

**d)** In the `main` method of a class called `CompanyApp`, do the following:
1. Input details for a developer and a project from the user.
2. Create the necessary objects and associate the developer with the project (demonstrating dependency).
3. Display the project and developer details using the overridden methods.
