### Question 01

A music store needs a system to manage its instrument inventory and sales. Write a Java program to handle the process of adding instruments and processing sales.

**a)** Write a class called `Instrument` to represent the details of a musical instrument with the following private attributes:

* `instrumentId`
* `name`
* `brand`
* `price`
* `quantityAvailable`

**b)** Implement **constructor overloading** in `Instrument`:
* One constructor should accept all five parameters: `instrumentId`, `name`, `brand`, `price`, and `quantityAvailable`.
* Another constructor should accept only `instrumentId`, `name`, and `brand`, assigning default values: `price = 0.0` and `quantityAvailable = 0`.

**c)** Implement **method overloading** for a method called `sellInstrument()`:
* One version should accept the number of units a customer wants to buy and display appropriate messages:
  * If `quantityAvailable` is less than the requested number, display:
    `"Not enough units available. Please select fewer units or another instrument."`
  * Otherwise:
    * Deduct the requested number of units from `quantityAvailable`.
    * Display: `"Sale successful!"`
* Another version should take **no parameters** and sell **1 unit by default**.

**d)** Implement a method called `displayInstrumentDetails()` to display the complete details of the instrument, including how many units are still available.

**e)** Write another Java class called `MusicStoreApp` to perform the following tasks:
I. Input details of **two instruments** from the user ‚Äî one using the full constructor and one using the overloaded constructor.
II. Ask how many units a customer wants to buy for each instrument, and process the sale using both versions of the `sellInstrument()` method.
III. After all sale operations, display the details of both instruments using the `displayInstrumentDetails()` method.
