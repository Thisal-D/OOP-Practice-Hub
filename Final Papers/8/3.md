### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an instrument serial number and the year it was manufactured, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

• **InvalidSerialNumber** – is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Serial number must be exactly 10 characters and start with 'INS'"` if the user input for the serial number does not conform to these requirements.

• **InvalidManufactureYear** – is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Manufacture year must be between 1950 and current year"` if the user input for the year is less than 1950 or greater than the current year.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **InstrumentRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the instrument serial number and manufacture year and then validate those for the above two conditions.
