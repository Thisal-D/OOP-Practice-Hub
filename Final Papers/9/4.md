### Question 04

A hospital wants to manage its departments, doctors, and patient records. Design a Java program that demonstrates **inheritance**, **aggregation**, and **composition** as follows:

**a)** Create a base class called `Person` with the following private attributes:
* `personId`
* `name`

Include a constructor to initialize these attributes and a method `displayInfo()` to display the person's details.

**b)** Create a subclass called `Doctor` that inherits from `Person` and adds:
* `specialization` (private attribute)

Override the `displayInfo()` method to display the doctor's details along with specialization.

**c)** Create a class called `Department` with the following private attributes:
* `departmentId`
* `departmentName`
* A list of `Doctor` objects as its staff

The relationship between `Department` and `Doctor` should be **aggregation**. (Doctors can exist independently of departments.)

Add methods to:
- Add a doctor to the department.
- Display department details, including listing all doctors.

**d)** Create a class called `PatientRecord` with the following private attributes:
* `recordId`
* `illness`
* **A `Doctor` object** representing the doctor in charge
* **A `MedicalHistory` object** (see below)

The relationship between `PatientRecord` and `MedicalHistory` should be **composition**, meaning each `PatientRecord` creates and owns its own `MedicalHistory`.

**e)** Create a class called `MedicalHistory` with the following private attributes:
* `notes`
* `dateOfAdmission`
* `dateOfDischarge`

Add a method to display medical history details.

**f)** In the `main` method of a class called `HospitalApp`, do the following:
1. Input details for two doctors and a department. Add both doctors to the department.
2. Input details for a patient and their medical history. Assign one of the doctors as the doctor in charge.
3. Display department details, patient record, assigned doctor, and the patient‚Äôs medical history.

**Tips:**
- Show how aggregation and composition work in your code.
- Use inheritance for `Person` and `Doctor`.
- When a department is deleted, doctors remain; when a patient record is deleted, its medical history is also deleted.
