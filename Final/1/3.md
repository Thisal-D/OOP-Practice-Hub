### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter an email address and phone number, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

• **InvalidEmailFormat** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "The email address must contain '@' symbol" if the user input for the email address does not contain the '@' symbol.

• **InvalidPhoneNumberLength** - is an exception class that prints out the error message "The phone number must be exactly 10 digits long" if the number of digits in the user input for the phone number is not equal to 10.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **ValidationApp** to get the user inputs for the email address and phone number and then validate those for the above two conditions. 

**Exception Handling Requirements:**

If the input has one or more custom exceptions, you should have proper try-catch statements to handle the exceptions.
