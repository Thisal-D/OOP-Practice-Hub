### Question 04

Develop a **Vehicle Management System** that demonstrates both **inheritance** and **composition**.

---

#### Vehicle Class (Base Class)

The `Vehicle` class represents a general vehicle with the following attributes and methods:

**Attributes:**
- `vehicleID` (String) - Unique identifier for the vehicle
- `manufacturer` (String) - Name of the manufacturer
- `engine` (Engine) - Composition: every vehicle has an engine

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize vehicle attributes and engine
- `displayVehicleDetails()` - Print vehicle ID, manufacturer, and engine details

---

#### Engine Class (Component Class)

The `Engine` class models the engine of a vehicle with the following details:

**Attributes:**
- `engineNumber` (String) - Engine serial number
- `capacity` (double) - Engine capacity in liters

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize engine attributes
- `displayEngineDetails()` - Print engine number and capacity

---

#### Car Class (Derived Class)

The `Car` class inherits from `Vehicle` and represents a car with additional attributes:

**Attributes:**
- `numDoors` (int) - Number of doors in the car
- `carType` (String) - Type of car (e.g., Sedan, Hatchback, SUV)

**Methods:**
- **Parameterized Constructor** - Initialize all attributes including base class attributes
- `displayCarDetails()` - Print all vehicle details along with car-specific details

---

### Implement the Main Class

- Create an `Engine` object
- Create a `Car` object using the parameterized constructor, passing the `Engine` object
- Call `displayCarDetails()` to show all details of the car including engine information

---

## Main Method Requirements

1. **Create Engine Object**
   - Instantiate an `Engine` with engine number and capacity

2. **Create Car Object**
   - Instantiate a `Car` object with vehicle ID, manufacturer, the created engine, number of doors, and car type

3. **Display Results**
   - Call `displayCarDetails()` to print complete details of the car and its engine
