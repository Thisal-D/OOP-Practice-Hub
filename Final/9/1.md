### Question 01

An electricity provider wants to calculate monthly bills for customers, with an optional discount for eco-friendly usage. Write a Java program to handle this.

---

**a)** Create a class called `ElectricityAccount` with the following private attributes:

* `accountId`
* `customerName`
* `unitsConsumed`
* `ratePerUnit`

---

**b)** Implement **constructor overloading** in `ElectricityAccount`:

* One constructor should accept all four parameters.
* Another should accept only `accountId` and `customerName`, assigning:
  `unitsConsumed = 0` and `ratePerUnit = 0.0`

---

**c)** Implement **method overloading** for a method `calculateBill()`:

* One version takes **no parameters** and returns `unitsConsumed * ratePerUnit`.
* Another version takes a **discount rate (e.g., 0.10 for 10%)** and applies it to the total bill before returning it.

---

**d)** Add a method `displayAccountDetails()` to show:

* Account ID
* Customer Name
* Units Consumed
* Rate Per Unit
* Total Bill (without discount)

---

**e)** Write a class called `ElectricityBillingApp` that:

1. Accepts input for two customer accounts (one with the full constructor, one with the overloaded one).
2. Asks for a discount rate.
3. Calculates and displays the bill using both versions of `calculateBill()`.
4. Shows customer details using `displayAccountDetails()`.

---

#### üåü Sample Expected Output:

```yaml
Enter details for first customer:
Account ID: A001
Customer Name: Alice
Units Consumed: 350
Rate Per Unit: 6.5

Enter details for second customer:
Account ID: A002
Customer Name: Bob

Enter discount rate (e.g., 0.1 for 10%): 0.10

Total bill for Alice (no discount): ‚Çπ2275.0
Total bill for Alice (with discount): ‚Çπ2047.5

Total bill for Bob (no discount): ‚Çπ0.0
Total bill for Bob (with discount): ‚Çπ0.0

Final Account Details:
Account ID: A001
Customer Name: Alice
Units Consumed: 350
Rate Per Unit: ‚Çπ6.5
Total Bill: ‚Çπ2275.0
-------------------------
Account ID: A002
Customer Name: Bob
Units Consumed: 0
Rate Per Unit: ‚Çπ0.0
Total Bill: ‚Çπ0.0
-------------------------
```
