### Question 03

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a vehicle registration number and the year of manufacture, then perform the following validations using two different custom exception classes as follows:

**Custom Exception Classes:**

• **InvalidRegistrationNumber** – is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Registration number must be exactly 7 characters and start with 'VH'"` if the user input for the registration number does not conform to these requirements.

• **InvalidManufactureYear** – is an exception class that prints out the error message `"Year of manufacture must be between 1980 and current year"` if the user input for the year is less than 1980 or greater than the current year.

**Main Application Class:**

Write another class called **VehicleRegistrationApp** to get the user inputs for the vehicle registration number and year of manufacture and then validate those for the above two conditions.
