## 🔥 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | How it is used                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| *Association* | Project *has a* ProjectManager and team (SoftwareEngineers). |
| *Inheritance* | SoftwareEngineer and ProjectManager *inherit* from Person. |
| *Override*    | Both override displayInfo() to show their details differently. |

---

## public static void main(String[] args)
  - create a `Project`
  - call the `displayInfo` Method
